REFORMATTING DATA

Aggregate data into total deaths and 55 or older

```{r}

  agg.respmortality$Age[i] = "Everyone"
}

agg.respmortality = na.omit(agg.respmortality)
rownames(agg.respmortality) = NULL

x = 1

for (i in rows3){
  x = x+1
  agg.respmortality2 = rbind(agg.respmortality2,respmortality[i,])
  agg.respmortality2$Total_Deaths[x] = sum(respmortality$Total_Deaths[i:(i+3)])

rownames(agg.respmortality2) = NULL
old.respmortality = agg.respmortality2[,-7]

#How different are the two datasets? 
sum(old.respmortality$Total_Deaths == total.respmortality$Total_Deaths)
```
Note: There are only 8 different rows in the whole dataset


PLOT SOME HEATMAPS FOR TOTAL MORTALITY: 

```{r,message=FALSE}
years = 2014:2019
for (i in years){
  totaldeaths = total.respmortality %>% group_by(County,Year) %>% summarise(Total_Deaths = sum(Total_Deaths)) %>% filter(Year == i)

  #Plot onto a heatmap
  # Sample dataset with county proportions
  totaldeaths$County <- tolower(totaldeaths$County)
  
  # Merge county map data with the dataset containing proportions
  county_map_totaldeaths <- merge(county_map, totaldeaths, by.x = "subregion", by.y = "County")
  
  # Plot the heatmap using ggplot2
  heatmap_plot <- ggplot(county_map_totaldeaths, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
    geom_polygon(aes(fill = Total_Deaths), color = "black", size = 0.2) +  # Heatmap fill with     county lines
    coord_fixed() +
    labs(title = paste0("Total Respiratory Related Deaths in ", i),
         fill = "Deaths") +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  
  # Display the heatmap plot
  print(heatmap_plot)  
}
```


PLOT SOME HEATMAPS FOR OLD PEOPLE MORTALITY: 

```{r,message=FALSE}
for (i in years){
  olddeaths = old.respmortality %>% group_by(County,Year) %>% summarise(Total_Deaths = sum(Total_Deaths)) %>% filter(Year == i)

  #Plot onto a heatmap

    geom_polygon(aes(fill = Total_Deaths), color = "black", size = 0.2) +  # Heatmap fill with     county lines

    scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  
  # Display the heatmap plot

```

Note: Basically the same heatmap as total deaths




Reformat dataset into time series format (rows are counties, columns are months)

Total deaths: 

```{r}
months = unique(total.respmortality$Month)
years = sort(unique(total.respmortality$Year))
counties = unique(total.respmortality$County)
x = 0

total.mortality.ts = matrix(1,nrow = 58, ncol = 72)

for (k in counties){
  county.ts = c()
  x = x+1
  
  for (i in years){
    for (j in months){
      deaths = total.respmortality %>% filter(County == k) %>%  filter(Year == i) %>% filter(Month == j) %>% select(Total_Deaths) %>% as.numeric()
      county.ts = c(county.ts,deaths)
    }
  } 
  
  total.mortality.ts[x,] = county.ts
}

# How many counties have rows of all 0s? 33
# count = 0
# 
# for (i in 1:58){
#   row = na.omit(total.mortality.ts[i,])
# 
#   if (sum(row) == 0){
#     count = count+1
#   }
# }


#Label time series data 
total.mortality.ts = as.data.frame(total.mortality.ts)

dates = c()
x=1
for (i in years){
  for (j in months){
    dates[x] = sprintf("%1.0f/%1.0f",j,i)
    x = x+1
  }
}

colnames(total.mortality.ts) = dates
ID = c(1:58)
total.mortality.ts = cbind(ID,counties,total.mortality.ts)

#test
mean(na.omit(total.mortality.ts[,11]))

#Attach cluster designations from SoA Data Analysis
clusterlabels = data.frame(CA_data_cluster$NAME,clus5$groups)
names(clusterlabels) = c("counties","Cluster")

o = order(clusterlabels$counties)
clusterlabels = clusterlabels[o,]

total.mortality.ts = left_join(clusterlabels,total.mortality.ts,by = "counties")
```


HOW MANY 0s DOES EACH COUNTY HAVE?

```{r}
numzeros_total = c()
for (i in 1:58){
  numzeros_total[i] = length(which(total.mortality.ts[i,3:74] == 0))
}

numzeros_total
propzeros_total = numzeros_total/72

length(which(propzeros_total > 0.85))
countycodes$value_represented[which(propzeros_total > 0.75)]

hist(propzeros_total,breaks = 20 ,xlab = "Proportion of months with 0 deaths",main = "Do some counties have more strings of 0s than others?")
```

- 43 out of 58 counties have more than 75% 0s in their time series
- 41 out of 58 counties have more than 85% 0s in their time series
- 38 out of 58 counties have more than 90% 0s in their time series
- 23 out of 58 counties have more than 95% 0s in their time series
- Some of the counties are pretty big e.g. Santa Barbara, San Francisco 
- Histogram shows a wide range, majority of data is between 0.65 and 1 


Old people deaths: 

```{r}
x = 0

old.mortality.ts = matrix(1,nrow = 58, ncol = 72)

for (k in counties){
  county.ts = c()
  x = x+1
  
  for (i in years){
    for (j in months){
      deaths = old.respmortality %>% filter(County == k) %>%  filter(Year == i) %>% filter(Month == j) %>% select(Total_Deaths) %>% as.numeric()
      county.ts = c(county.ts,deaths)
    }
  } 
  
  old.mortality.ts[x,] = county.ts
}


# How many counties have rows of all 0s? 33
# count = 0
# 
# for (i in 1:58){
#   row = na.omit(old.mortality.ts[i,])
#   
#   if (sum(row) == 0){
#     count = count+1
#   }
# }

#Label time series data 
old.mortality.ts = as.data.frame(old.mortality.ts)

colnames(old.mortality.ts) = dates
old.mortality.ts = cbind(ID,counties,old.mortality.ts)

#test
mean(na.omit(old.mortality.ts[,11]))


#Attach cluster designations from SoA Data Analysis
old.mortality.ts = left_join(clusterlabels,old.mortality.ts,by = "counties")
```


HOW MANY 0s DOES EACH COUNTY HAVE?

```{r}
numzeros_old = c()
for (i in 1:58){
  numzeros_old[i] = length(which(old.mortality.ts[i,3:74] == 0))
}

numzeros_old
propzeros_old = numzeros_old/72

length(which(propzeros_old > 0.95))
countycodes$value_represented[which(propzeros_old > 0.75)]

hist(propzeros_old,breaks = 20 ,xlab = "Proportion of months with 0 deaths",main = "Do some counties have more strings of 0s than others?")
```

- Proportion of 0 trends are almost exactly the same between the two datasets, same counties, slightly different histograms though 
- 37 out of 58 counties have more than 90% 0s in their time series
- BUT 0 have more than 95% 0s in their time series (reflected in time series)


AGGREGATING (POP WEIGHTED MEAN) MORTALITY DATA INTO CLUSTERS AS OPPOSED TO EACH COUNTY

Total deaths: 

```{r}
#County populations by year pulled from SoA data
countypops = CA_data %>% filter(Year > 2013) %>% select(Total_Pop,County,Year) %>% unique()
countypops = cbind(countypops,Cluster = rep(clusterlabels$Cluster,each=6))

cluster_mortality_total = matrix(NA,nrow = 72,ncol = 5)

for (i in 1:5){
  cluster = total.mortality.ts %>% filter(Cluster == i)
  year = 2014
  
  for(j in 1:72){
    #Obtain a weighted mean based on population
    col = cluster[,j+3]
    
    pops = countypops %>% filter(Year == year,Cluster == i) %>% select(Total_Pop) 
    cluster.pop = sum(pops)
    cluster.popweights = pops/cluster.pop
    cluster_mortality_total[j,i] = weighted.mean(data.frame(col),cluster.popweights)
    
    if ((j>12) & (j<25)){
      year = 2015
    }
    
    else if ((j>24) & (j<37)){
      year = 2016
    }
    
    else if ((j>36) & (j<49)){

    }
    
    else if ((j>48) & (j<61)){
      year = 2018
    }
    
    else if ((j>60) & (j<73)){
      year = 2019
    }
    
    else{
      year = 2014
    }
  }
}

colnames(cluster_mortality_total) = c("Cluster 1","Cluster 2",
                                "Cluster 3","Cluster 4",
                                "Cluster 5")
rownames(cluster_mortality_total) = colnames(total.mortality.ts[4:75])
cluster_mortality_total = data.frame(cluster_mortality_total)

# #Removes Sept-Dec 2014 NAs
# cluster_mortality_total = na.omit(cluster_mortality_total)
```



WHAT TYPE OF GRAPH DO WE GET IF WE RUN HUGE ON THE CLUSTER MORTALITY DATA? IS IT ALSO COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED LIKE FOR SOA DATA?

```{r}
lambda1 = robsel(as.matrix(cluster_mortality_total),alpha=0.95,B=200)
out.glasso = huge(as.matrix(cluster_mortality_total),lambda = lambda1,method="glasso")

glasso.ebic = huge.select(out.glasso,criterion = "ebic")
glasso.ebic$refit
```

Adjacency matrix is all 0s just like for SoA data... maybe SKATER clustering working too well?
